## Introduction

This simulation explores the dynamics of an SIR model, which is a fundamental model in epidemiology. The model tracks the number of individuals in a population who are susceptible to a disease, infected with the disease, and recovered from the disease.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and Jupyter Notebook.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Simulation-of-an-SIR-Stochastic-Process-in-Continuous-Time.git
   cd Simulation-of-an-SIR-Stochastic-Process-in-Continuous-Time
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
   ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to see the simulation.

```bash
jupyter notebook "Pythod SIR Stochastic process.ipynb"
```
